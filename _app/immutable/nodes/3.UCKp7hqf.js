		and we work from businesses, offices or work from home. Having manmade structures be the main
		setting where many of us spend most of our time, we should get out and explore. Nature is
		beautiful and life is short, we should enjoy it while we can. I&#39;ve lived and worked in and
		around a city for a long time, but in the evenings or on weekends I have always tried to get out

		API that were created by photographers from all over the world that contribute their images to that
		platform. Each random image presented credits them below it if you&#39;re curious. If you would prefer
		to be slightly more specific about a random image you can hit the form below the &#39;Random Natural
		Inspiration&#39; button to search. No guarantees! This simple web project was the first time that I have
		built anything using
