		<span class="natural-span">Natural Travel Inspiration</span> â€” we all live in cities or suburbs,
		work from businesses, offices or work from home. Having manmade structures be the main setting
		where many of us spend most of our time, we should get out and explore. Nature is beautiful and
		life is short, we should enjoy it while we can. I've lived and worked in and around a city for a
		long time, but in the evenings or on weekends I have always tried to get out and enjoy what was
		here before I was born. Many of my travels have revolved around it. So I made this web project
		as a way to inspire myself and others. It pulls random images from the
		<a

			aria-label="Unsplash Link">Unsplash</a
		>
		API that were created by photographers from all over the world that contribute their images to that
		platform. Each random image presented credits them below it if you're curious. If you would prefer
		to be slightly more specific about a random image you can hit the form below the 'Random Natural
		Inspiration' button to search. No guarantees! This simple web project was the first time that I have
		built anything using
